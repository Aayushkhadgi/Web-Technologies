        <h5><span>Developer </span>& Designer</h5>
        <p>"I am currently in the process of obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Herald College Kathmandu,
            where I have gained a comprehensive understanding of various programming languages and software development techniques.
            I have little experience in web development and have completed several projects as part of my coursework.
            I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages and am confident in my ability to adapt quickly to new challenges."
